Installation
************

Requirements
============

- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ 2.6 (>=2.6.5), 2.7, 3.1 or 3.2

- `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_

Installing Seabird 
==================

Using pip
---------

    pip install --no-deps seabird

.. note::

    The ``--no-deps`` flag is optional, but highly recommended if you already
    have Numpy installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to "help" you
    by upgrading your Numpy installation, which may not always be desired.
